\usage{
glue(...)

dup(x, n = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{character, phrase or non-phrase string.}

\item{x}{character, phrase or non-phrase string.}

\item{n}{integer, number of repetitions.}
}
\value{
phrase on non-phrase character string.
}
\description{
Helper functions for appending or pasting musical phrases and other strings together as well as repetition.
The functions \code{glue} and \code{dup} are based on base functions \code{paste} and\code{rep}, respectively, but are tailored for efficiency in creating musical phrases.
These functions respect and retain the phrase class when applied to phrases.
Combining a phrase with a non-phrase string will assume compatibility and result in a new phrase object.
}
\details{
This is especially useful for repeated instances. This function applies to general slur notation as well.
Multiple input formats are allowed. Total number of note durations must be even because all slurs require start and stop points.
}
\examples{
glue(8, "16-", "8^")
dup(1, 2)
x <- phrase("c ec'g' ec'g'", "4 4 2", "5 432 432")
y <- phrase("a", 1, 5)
glue(x, y)
glue(x, dup(y, 2))
glue(x, "r1") # add a simple rest instance
class(glue(x, y))
class(dup(y, 2))
class(glue(x, "r1"))
class(dup("r1", 2))
class(glue("r1", "r4"))
